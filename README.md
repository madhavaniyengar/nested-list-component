# nested-list-component

## Installation
In your react project, run the command npm i @miyen/react-nested-list

## Importing into your project
Once you have installed the package, write the line "import Nested from '@miyen/react-nested-list'" at the top of your .js file. 
Now you can use the nested component as if it's any other component.

## Actually using it
Pass in a nested array into the data prop that contains the list items and their children. Below is a demonstration of one such array and the output it produces.
